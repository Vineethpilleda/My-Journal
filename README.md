# My-Journal

Note: This was my First ever Data Project, also from my own journal data, which inspired me to move into Data Field.

Welcome to my trading journal! ðŸ“ˆðŸ“‰ 
Here, I document my trading entries, exit, logic behind my trade, and other insights as I navigate the dynamic world of financial markets. Through this journal, I aim to track my trades, analyze patterns, and continuously learn from both successes and setbacks.

**Key Features**:

***Trade Logs***: Detailed records of each trade, including entry and exit points, position size, and reasoning behind the trade.

***Market Analysis***: Regular updates on market conditions, technical and losses occured, and potential opportunities.

***Risk Management***: Insights into risk management strategies employed to safeguard capital and optimize returns.

***Lessons Learned***: Reflections on lessons learned from trades, both profitable and unprofitable, contributing to continuous improvement.

Feel free to explore my trading journey, and don't hesitate to share your thoughts or insights.
